This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}

source("profiling/1.RNA-seq/1.A.1_run_alignment.R")


```


### prepare genomic features

```{}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("GenomicFeatures")
library(GenomicFeatures)
txdb <- makeTranscriptDbFromGFF(file="~/DBcenter/BD_v1.0/annot_v1.2/Bdistachyon_192_gene_exons.gff3",
                                format="gff3",
                                dataSource="ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/compgen/phytozome/v9.0/Bdistachyon/",
                                species="brachypodium")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
